                <p>The barista pick of the week was chosing oh so carefully by our barista, Chris! 
                    Chris is so passionate about where his beans come from and their stories. This special drink is an Iced blonde lavendar latte.
                    The bright flavors from the espresso derives from the Latin America and African regions in the coffee belt. These climates produce slightly chocolatey 
                    and floral/citrus notes which we think pairs great with the lavendar. </p>
