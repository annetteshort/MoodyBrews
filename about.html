                    Rhea Krueger and Dustin Huetinck have always dreamed of owninf their own coffee shop. 
                    Previously, Krueger had been an English professor at Snead State Community College and Huetinck had worked in Pell City. 
                    Once they decided it was something they wanted to finally take the leap on, they bought the old Jamokas coffee shop in Guntersville, AL. 
                    Renovations started in October 2022 and ended in January 2023! It finally felt like their dreams were coming true.
